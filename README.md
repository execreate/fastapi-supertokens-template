# FastAPI + Supertokens template

A simple starting point for your [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) application that uses
[Supertokens](https://supertokens.com) for user auth.

## About

The template includes the following to help you to get started:
1. Makefile for dependency management with `pip-tools`
2. Dockerfile and compose files for local development
3. SQLAlchemy for ORM (uses async engine) and Alembic for database migrations
4. Simple authentication for docs page
5. CRUD operations generic class with pagination
6. Support for API versioning (`https://api.yourdomain.com/v1/`)
7. Testing setup

## How to use

Make sure to mark the `app/` folder as source in your IDE otherwise you'll get import errors.
And since all your code (except tests) lives inside `app/` folder, you should import modules like this:
```python
from core.config import settings
```

and NOT like this:
```python
# this will throw an error!
from app.core.config import settings
```

### Start coding

Just click on that green `Use this template` button to start coding. There is [a dummy app](app/api/v1/blog_post.py) that
is already implemented for you so that you can quickly learn how to use the [CRUD factory](app/db/crud/base.py).

### Local setup

The following command will start a Postgres database and a Supertokens core locally in Docker:
```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up -d
```
so that you can do
```shell
cd app; uvicorn main:app
```

Otherwise, if you want to build a docker container with your app and run it, you can use the other compose file:
```shell
docker compose -f docker-compose-test.yml up -d
```

### Tests

Place your tests in `tests/` folder in the root of the project and run the following command:
```shell
ENVIRONMENT=test pytest
```

To run the tests you need a database, you can set it up with docker compose as shown above. Don't forget to run
migrations too:
```shell
alembic upgrade head
```

Check out the [tests folder](tests) for more information.

### Documentation

If you run the code without any changes, you'll find the
[documentation page here](http://localhost:8001/docs). The default username is `docs_user`
and the password is `simple_password`.
